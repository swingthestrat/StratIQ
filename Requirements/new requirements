Core Scanning Functionality
Scan Modes: The scanner must support two distinct operational modes:

Signal Mode: Displays patterns that are currently "In Force" or acting as a continuation (e.g., a "2-Up" continuing upwards).

Setup Mode: Displays potential setups forming for the next period (e.g., used after market close to find "Inside Bars" for the next day).

Time Frame Support: Users must be able to toggle between specific time frames: 15m, 30m, 60m, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly.

Pattern Recognition ("The Strat"): The engine must automatically identify and filter for specific price action scenarios, including:

Candle States: Inside Bars (1), Directional Bars (2-Up/2-Down), Outside Bars (3).

Complex Patterns: 2-1-2 Reversals, 3-1-2 Reversals, Rev Strats, Failed 2s (e.g., 2-Down Green, 2-Up Red).

Candle Shapes: Hammers and Shooters.

Expansions: Range expansions.

3. Dashboard & User Interface
Customizable Grid:

Columns: Users must be able to add, remove, and reorder columns via drag-and-drop.

Data Points: Available columns must include Ticker, Pattern (e.g., "2-1"), Current Candle status, Average Volume, In-Force Status, Dollar Change, and Full Time Frame Continuity (FTFC).

Quick Filters: A dedicated button/menu for one-click application of common filters (e.g., "Show all Hammers," "Show all 2-2 Reversals").

My Filters: A section for users to save, name, and retrieve their own custom filter configurations.

Ticker Search: A global search bar to isolate a specific ticker (e.g., "QQQ") to view its current state and patterns instantly.

4. Market Intelligence (Sector Stats)
Aggregated Statistics: A collapsible panel at the bottom of the screen that displays market-wide breadth.

Metrics:

Must compare the percentage of "2-Ups" vs. "2-Downs" for the S&P, NASDAQ, and individual sectors (e.g., Basic Materials).

Visual Logic (Color Coding):

Green: Indicates a bullish bias (more Ups than Downs).

Red: Indicates a bearish bias (more Downs than Ups).

Yellow: Highlights extreme outliers (the strongest or weakest sectors, e.g., >83% directional bias).

Latency: Data currently updates every 1-2 minutes, with a requirement to reduce this to near real-time (seconds) in future iterations.

5. Visualization & Analysis Tools
Integrated Charting: Clicking a ticker in the results list must open an integrated chart window.

Multi-Timeframe View: The chart view must display multiple timeframes simultaneously (e.g., Month, Week, Day, 60m) to allow for immediate trend analysis without leaving the scanner.

Data Export: The system must allow users to export the current scan results to CSV or Excel formats for external tracking.
